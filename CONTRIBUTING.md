# Make sure you have commonly required Command Line Tools installed (e.g., through Xcode).
# This will install things like Git, GCC, and more.
xcode-select --install

# Install Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) for package management.
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
